🧼 **Clean Architecture** is all about organizing our project in a way that’s:  
- 🛠️ **Easy to maintain**  
- 🧪 **Easy to test**  
- 🔌 **Easy to integrate new technology**  

It does this by **separating concerns** and following **strict dependency rules**. The higher-level components don’t depend on lower-level ones — they only depend on **abstractions**. Let’s break down the 4 key building blocks, ordered from **highest priority (most important)** to **lowest priority (least important)**:  

1️⃣ **Entity (Core Business Models)** 🧠  
- This is the 💖 **heart of our application**, containing our **core business objects** and **business rules**.  
- Entities should **not depend on any external tech** (like databases, web frameworks, or APIs).  
- **Example:** `User` model — it enforces business rules like:  
   - ✅ **User email must be unique**  
   - 🚫 **Users under 18 cannot create an account**  
- **Important Note:** Not all validations belong here! Field-level checks like **email format** and **age validation** stay here because they’re **inherent user properties**. But checks like **ensuring the email is unique** belong in the **use case layer**, since they require interacting with external systems (like a database).  

2️⃣ **Use Cases (Application Logic)** ⚙️🧠  
   - Use cases **define our app’s behavior** — they’re the **brains of the operation**. 🧑‍💻  
   - They **orchestrate how entities interact** 🕺💃 and call interfaces for external actions (like saving to a database).  
   - **No knowledge of HTTP, databases, or external systems** — only pure, beautiful business logic. 🧼✨  
   - Example: `CreateUser` 🆕, `CreditAccount` 💸, `TransferMoney` 💱.  

3️⃣ **Interface (External Communication)** 🌐📡  
   - This layer **connects the outside world** to our app — like HTTP handlers, CLI commands, gRPC, or message consumers. 🌍🔗  
   - It **translates external requests** 📩 into something our **use cases understand** and sends proper responses back. 💬  
   - Example: Gin HTTP handlers 🍜, middleware 🛡️, or even an API gateway 🚪.  

4️⃣ **Infrastructure (Tech & Tools)** 🏗️🔧  
   - This is where all the **external dependencies** live — our **databases** 🗄️, **message queues** 📬, **caching systems** 🧑‍🍳, and **third-party services** 🌐.  
   - It’s a **low-level detail** — and our use cases should **never depend directly on infrastructure**. ❌🏗️ Instead, we use **interfaces** to keep things flexible. 🤹‍♂️  
   - Example: PostgreSQL repo 🐘, Redis cache 🚀, AWS SES for emails 📧.

⚡ **Why is this awesome?**  
- 🧠 **Decoupled:** Change our database or framework without breaking business logic.  
- 🧪 **Testable:** Easily unit test our use cases with mocks.  
- 🌱 **Scalable:** Add new features without a tangled mess of code.  
- 🧩 **Flexible:** Mix and match different external tools — want to swap SQL for Redis? Go ahead!

Here’s a clean and simple folder structure for a basic CRUD user operation in Go, using an in-memory store and following clean architecture principles:  

```
📂 simple-CRUD
├── 📂 cmd                     # App entry point
│   └── main.go                # Starts the Gin server
│
└── 📂 pkg                     # Reusable app-specific code
   ├── 📂 entity              # Core business models
   │   └── user.go            # User struct and validation logic
   │
   ├── 📂 usecase             # Business logic
   │   └── user_usecase.go    # CRUD operations for user
   │
   ├── 📂 repository         # In-memory data store
   │   └── user_repo.go      # User data operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
   │
   ├── 📂 handler            # HTTP handlers (Gin controllers)
   │   └── user_handler.go   # Routes and request handling for user
   │
   └── 📂 router             # Router setup
        └── router.go         # Gin routes and setup            
```

**What’s happening here?** 🧠  
- `cmd/main.go` — Starts the app and initializes the router.  
- `pkg/entity` — Core business objects like the `User` struct and its validation rules.  
- `pkg/usecase` — Business logic for user operations (`CreateUser`, `UpdateUser`, etc.).  
- `pkg/repository` — In-memory storage operations, simulating a simple DB.  
- `pkg/handler` — HTTP handlers for CRUD operations, connecting the router to the use cases.  
- `pkg/middleware` — Optional, but if you want to add RBAC or other middleware later, this is the spot.  
- `pkg/router` — Sets up Gin routes and links them to the handlers.
