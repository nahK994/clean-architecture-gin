## 🧼 Clean Architecture Overview

Clean Architecture is all about organizing our project in a way that’s:
- 🛠️ **Easy to maintain**
- 🧪 **Easy to test**
- 🔌 **Easy to integrate new technology**

It achieves this by- 
**Separating concerns**- Separation the whole application into 4 building blocks, Entity, Use Case, Interface and Infructure.
**Dependency inversion rules**- Higher-level components don’t depend on lower-level ones — they only depend on abstractions.

Let’s break down the four key building blocks, ordered from highest priority (most important) to lowest priority (least important):

### 1️⃣ Entity (Core Business Models) 🧠
- 💖 **The heart of the application**, containing core business objects and basic validation rules.
- Should not depend on any external tech (like databases, web frameworks, or APIs).
- **Example:** `User` model enforcing business rules like:
   - ✅ Users under 18 cannot create an account
   - 🚫 User email must be unique
- **Important Note:** Field-level checks like email format, age validation belong here. But checking email uniquenes belong in the use case layer, as they require interacting with external systems (like database).

### 2️⃣ Use Cases (Application Logic) ⚙️🧠
- **Define the app’s behavior** — they’re the brains of the operation.
- Orchestrate how entities interact and call interfaces for external actions.
- Have no knowledge of HTTP, databases 🗄️, or external systems — only pure business logic.
- **Example:** `CreateUser`, `CreditAccount`, `TransferMoney`.

### 3️⃣ Interface (External Communication) 🌐📡
- **Connect the outside world** to the app — HTTP handlers, CLI commands, gRPC, etc.
- Translate external requests into something the use cases understand and send proper responses back.
- **Example:** Gin HTTP handlers, middleware, or an API gateway.

### 4️⃣ Infrastructure (Tech & Tools) 🏗️🔧
- **External dependencies** — databases, message queues, caching systems, third-party services.
- It’s a low-level detail — the use cases should never depend directly on infrastructure.
- **Example:** PostgreSQL repo, Redis cache, AWS SES for emails.

### ⚡ Why Clean Architecture?
- 🧠 **Decoupled:** Change the database or framework without breaking business logic.
- 🧪 **Testable:** Easily unit test use cases with mocks.
- 🌱 **Scalable:** Add new features without tangled code.
- 🧩 **Flexible:** Swap external tools easily — like switching from SQL to Redis.

### 🧠 How the Layers Interact
The typical flow follows:
```
handler -> usecase -> repository
```
**Why does `usecase -> repository` happen?**

As we have discussed before, higher-level components don’t depend on lower-level ones, that's why **use case depends on an abstraction (interface)**, not the concrete implementation of the repository. This keeps the dependency direction correct:
- The **use case defines an interface** like `UserRepository`, describing required operations.
- The **repository layer implements this interface**, handling actual database operations.
- The **use case knows only the interface**, not the implementation — maintaining decoupling.

If the **use case directly called the repository struct**, that would break the dependency rule because a higher-level policy would depend on a lower-level detail.
